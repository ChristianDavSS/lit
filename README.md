# **lit: Your project best friend 🥇**
### **What's 'lit'? ❓**
CLI Tool developed 100% in Golang in order to help you get quick information about your git respositories and project metrics. Thus, it can be really helpful for big work enviroments in order to improve productivity or detect code anomalies,
getting warnings about possible dangerous code.

### **Top features 🔝**
With the available commands, you can analyze anything you need from code to even repository metrics. The scanning does a search in your working directory looking for the scripts written on the supported languages to scan and calculates the cyclical
complexity so you can get feedback based in the metric.

### **Future features (plans)**
I want to add more specific filters to the scanner so you can scan the code by your favorite code conventions (***camelCase, CamelCase, sneak_case, etc***).

### **Supported languages for the code scan 💻**
Current supported languages: **Java, Python,  JavaScript**

Incoming support for the next languages: **C, C++, C#, Go, TypeScript**

### Why was this developed?
I developed ***Lit*** because I wanted to reinforce my Go knowledge by creating a useful and meaningful project that developers like me could use in their best projects to keep the code cleaner. Writting clean but efficient code is very important
because the code will always be read by developers and they must understand it.

### Support the project ♥️
Your **star ⭐** in the repository would be more than enough.

**Project open for contributions. Pull-requests are welcome :D.**
